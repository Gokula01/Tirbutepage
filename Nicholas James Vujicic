<ul>
<li>
                <strong>Nick Vujicic</strong> was born to Dushka and Boris Vujicic in 1982 in <strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong>. Although he was an otherwise healthy baby, Nick was born without arms and legs; he had no legs, but two small feet, one of which had two toes</li>
<li><strong>Nicholas James Vujicic</strong> the eldest son of <strong>Dushka</strong> and <strong>Boris</strong> was born in <strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong>, on December 4, 1982.
 The infant, though healthy in all other aspects, was born with autosomal recessive tetra-amelia, a rare condition where the child has no limbs at all, except feet with just two toes</li>
<li>Initially, it was quite difficult for the child and his family to cope up with the troubles that accompany the absence of hands and legs.</li>
<li> He wasn't even allowed to study in a normal school, even though there was nothing wrong with his IQ.
He gradually learnt to use his feet to write, type, play, and shave.</li>
He pursued his secondary education from the <strong>'Runcorn State High School'</strong>, Queensland, Australia, where he was also the head boy.
 He was also on the student council that carried out humanitarian work.</li>
<li>In 1990, <strong>Vujicic's</strong> determination and courage impressed the world, and he was felicitated with the <strong>'Australian Young Citizen Award'</strong>.</li>
<li>He was one of the contenders for the <strong>'Young Australian of the Year Award'</strong> in the year 2005.</li>
<li>In 2010, he won the <strong>'Best Actor in Short Film'</strong> award at the <strong>'Method Fest Independent Film Festival'</strong> for his performance in the role of Will, from the movie <strong>'The Butterfly Circus'</strong></li>
